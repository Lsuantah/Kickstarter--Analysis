# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
#Goal
The main goal of this project is to help analyze crowd funding campaign data to identify the most successful campaigns worth investing in.

##Trends Analysis on Kickstarter Data
Excel tools ncluding fomulas were used to create important values to incorporate into the data analysis. The data was formated to extract certain fields for the analysis. Some data fields were not readerble and had to be converted into conforming formats. Pivot tables and Charts were used to visualize important fields.
Descriptive statistical tools were apllied to provide trend analysis of the Data. The Mean, Median and Standard Deviation of the data gives us an idea of the spread of the data.
